1. Why the name charcoal?
=========================
Charcoal is used as sediment filter for water. Internet data is water for users, while Network Administrators would like to 
filter out the sediments that use up the bandwidth unnecessarily.

2. Why a web API based filter?
==============================
To make lives of adminstrators a bit easy. Instead of spending time and energy on periodically updating the blacklists from 
multiple sources, maintaining them, they should focus on getting things done. While we manage the blacklists.

It also helps a great deal if you have to manage 10s or 100s of locations. Managing blacklists and policies across them is a 
real pain. 

Charcoal helps you create and implement policies across distributed networks in a jiffy.
