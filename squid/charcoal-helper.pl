#For each requested URL, the rewriter will receive on line with the format
#
#	  [channel-ID <SP>] URL [<SP> extras]<NL>
#
#	See url_rewrite_extras on how to send "extras" with optional values to
#	the helper.
#	After processing the request the helper must reply using the following format:
#
#	  [channel-ID <SP>] result [<SP> kv-pairs]
#
#	The result code can be:
#
#	  OK status=30N url="..."
#		Redirect the URL to the one supplied in 'url='.
#		'status=' is optional and contains the status code to send
#		the client in Squids HTTP response. It must be one of the
#		HTTP redirect status codes: 301, 302, 303, 307, 308.
#		When no status is given Squid will use 302.
#
#	  OK rewrite-url="..."
#		Rewrite the URL to the one supplied in 'rewrite-url='.
#		The new URL is fetched directly by Squid and returned to
#		the client as the response to its request.
#
#	  OK
#		When neither of url= and rewrite-url= are sent Squid does
#		not change the URL.
#
#	  ERR
#		Do not change the URL.
#
#	  BH
#		An internal error occurred in the helper, preventing
#		a result being identified. The 'message=' key name is
#		reserved for delivering a log message.
